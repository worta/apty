# APTY
Dataset from the paper "Towards Human Understanding of Paraphrase Types in ChatGPT" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02302). It consists of two parts: The first part (APTY<sub>base</sub>) contains annotated paraphrases with specific atomic paraphrase types based on the ETPC dataset. The second part (APTY<sub>ranked</sub>) consists of human preferences ranking paraphrases with specific atomic paraphrase types.

The code to generate the paraphrase candidates can be found at https://github.com/worta/generate_apt_paraphrases. The generation uses ChatGPT. The dataset is also available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/worta/apty.
